1) To add a variable, write: {{ variable }}
2) To add a conditional (if), write: {% if variable %} ... {% endif %}
(Code goes instead of ...)
3) If the 'if' is false, you could add an 'else' before the {% endif %} as follows:
{% if variable %}
  --- Some Code ---
{% else %}
  --- Alternative Code if 'if' is false ---
{% endif %}
3) To add a 'for' loop, write: {% for variable in array %} ... {% endfor %}
4) To add a block, write: {% block name %} ... {% endblock %}
5) To extend a mother template, write (before any other Jinja code): {% extends "base.html" %}
6) To add a comment in Jinja (it will not be displays in the browser), write: {# comment goes here #}
7) If you think that a variable might contain one or more character of the following : < , > , *, &
then write |e (pipe, and then e) after the name of the variable as follows:
{{ variable|e }}
This is called escaping, and it is a safety measure.
