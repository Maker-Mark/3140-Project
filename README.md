# Setup

## Installation

Installing from the `requirements.txt` file.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

When new Python libraries are required, update the `requirements.txt` file using the command

```
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "updated requirements"
```

## Running

# Flask-SQLAlchemy-REST

Small, Flask app that demonstrates skeleton of a Flask-SQLAlchemy RESTFul api

# Understanding Serializing/De-serializing

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7907596/json-dumps-vs-flask-jsonify

# Introduction

- This Flask application uses SQLAlchemy and marshmallow(for serializing/de- serializing) to make a small, REST + CRUD(create, read, update, delete) API.

# Getting started

- `git clone` the repo!

- If you're using a virtual environment activate it!(I'll assume virtualenv with the named environment "venv"),

- Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get all the dependencies.

- `python app.py` should get you up and running!

- Try it out in Postman! (postman is a API development environment that lets you test PUT, GET, DELETE, POST functionality)

# Handling json and python dictionaries

If you're processing a request in flask (hopefully using the request import), you'll need a way to turn a json request into a python readable form. Additionally, you're

## Handling an incoming json response

A good way to do this is to take your request and invoke the `.get_json()` method on request. This goes into the request and "parses-out" the data from the json into python ready code! One important thing to note is that the content type header and form of the json must already be valid, otherwise a error will be thrown. Using flask request already does this for us, but it's important to keep in mind.

See the example code below

```
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string
...
@app.route('/takejson',methods=["POST"])
def takejson():	#Let's say we sent the following json: {"name":"Anton"}
    data = request.get_json() #The data var is now a python dictionary with the json values!
    return render_template_string('hello {{ what }}', what=data["name"])
    #Return the data that we pulled out and expect!
```

## Sending a JSON response

After we have handled data, or done whatever was needed, we're going to want our API to send a response in JSON form so that our API can talk to any(almost) interface. A simple way to do this is to use flask's jsonify module that returns a flask.Response() object that does some of the grunt work for us (setting the header's content type to application/json and so on) vs using alternative methods like json.dumps() which simply attempts to converted to json string.

Let's take a look at an example below

```
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
...
@app.route('/takejson',methods=["GET"])
def takejson():	#Let's say we sent the following json: {"name":"Anton"}
    data = {"Is the earth flat?":"Maybe"} # Make a python dict (could have been generated from the user)    return render_template_string('hello {{ what }}', what=data["name"])
    return jsonify(data) #Return a valid-form json as a flask.Response object.
```

Try this out using a API interface such as Postman!

# Going between json and python dictionaries

## Loading JSON-String(python string that happens to be JSON format) into a python Object

## Use the `json.loads()` method to load a python string that is valid JSON into a python dictionary

Given:

```
#Python string that is valid json
str_json= '''{
	"users": ["appMan", "CSMajor1993", null, "leetc0der1337"]
	}'''
data = json.loads(str_json) #Passing the string into the load s turns the json string into a python dict!
#Parses null into None, Json array to lists and so on.

print(data) # Prints the now dictionary
users_list = data['users']
# We can loop through the users by using the key to get the list
for username in users_list:
	print(username)
```

## Use the `json.dumps()` to dump a python object to a JSON-valid string

If we wanted to edit the python dictionary we now have from the json, we can simply `del` to delete a key and value pair, or remove it from the list.
Given:

```

print(data)
# Replace the list with an updated list in the dict
data['users'] = [username for username in users_list if (username !=  'appMan')]
print(data)
# Make a new json string from our now modified dictionary
updated_json_string = json.dumps(data, indent=2) #2nd param allows sort_keys and style the json-string

# Note the conversion from null to None back to null!
print(updated_json_string)
```

# Running your app in debug mode using the flask CLI

    If you're setting FLASK_DEBUG=1, and working in a virtual env you may find a infamous `Restarting with stat` issue.
    To work around this issue run `python -m flask run`. This seems to be an odd issue with the -m / module invocation falling off when using the debugger.
